# Map Export Functionality (Leaflet.js + jQuery)

This project showcases a **Map Export Feature** built using **Leaflet.js**, **jQuery**, and **dom-to-image**. It allows users to take a screenshot of the Leaflet map, including all drawn layers and legends, and save it as an image. The captured map can also be stored on the server using AJAX.
